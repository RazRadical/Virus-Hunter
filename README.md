Presenting a high-energy first-person shooter project that I lent a hand in developing amongst a team of other developers with Unreal Engine. I played a critical role in art direction and was responsible for creating conceptual artwork, 3D enemy models, item power-ups, as well as producing many other game assets. This segment showcases the intro scene and some initial gameplay footage.
